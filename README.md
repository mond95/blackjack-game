# Black Jack Game

- This black jack game using html, css and javascript.
- The javascript uses functions to get a random card and to check whether the first two cards added together are below 21.
- If so, they are able to click on the 'New card' button to get an extra card and this is added to that total and checked if it is below 21 and this continues until they are over 21 where they have lost the game.
- I have added additional stylings on hovering over the buttons and have made it so that after you have gone over 21, the 'new card' button is no longer functional and this is reflected in the styling (it goes grey and an error message is displayed).
- Only upon clicking on the 'Start game' button again does the styling of the 'New card' button go back to the default colour settings and the default colour hover settings.


## Acknowledgements

 - I built this with the help of the Scrimba Javascript course but I have also added my own additional functions and features on top of this
